# HER2NI — Interaction-Level Coherence Telemetry

HER2NI (Human–Emergent Resonance to Neural Intelligence) is a protocol for
cross-substrate cognitive alignment between humans and AI systems.

The HER2NI framework defines model-agnostic coherence metrics for analysing
interaction stability, drift, contradiction, and collapse in multi-turn
human–AI dialogue, with applications to AI safety, evaluation, and
governance-oriented research.

---

## Why This Exists

As AI systems scale, many safety failures emerge from **interaction dynamics**
— loops, escalation, contradiction, and loss of grounding — rather than from
isolated outputs.

HER2NI exists to provide **interaction-level observability**: a lightweight
telemetry layer that surfaces instability earlier, without inferring mental
states, diagnosing users, or replacing policy or governance systems.

## Repository Scope

This repository hosts:

- The public landing page for **HER2NI Research**
- Links to the HER2NI protocol paper and related research artifacts
- Documentation and tooling for the **HER2NI reference implementation (experimental)**
- Experimental materials for validation, falsification, and metric calibration
- Future documentation for HER-Crystal visualisations and HER2NI APIs

This repository is intended for **research, evaluation, and safety-oriented experimentation only**.

## HER2NI Reference Implementation — v0.1 (Experimental)

### Overview

This repository contains the **HER2NI v0.1 reference implementation**, an
experimental, implementation-agnostic toolkit for working with HER2NI
coherence metrics in human–AI interaction research.

Protocol specification: HER2NI v1.0 (published, stable)  
Reference implementation: v0.1 (experimental)

HER2NI v0.1 is intended for **research and evaluation contexts**.  
It is **not** a production system and **not** a clinical tool.

---

## What v0.1 Provides

HER2NI v0.1 implements the **minimum viable instrumentation layer** required
to operationalise the HER2NI protocol primitives.

Included capabilities:

- **HER-State packet encoding and decoding**  
  JSON and CBOR representations  
  Versioned schema (her2ni-1.0)

- **Schema validation**  
  Field presence, range enforcement, and type checks

- **Baseline coherence metrics**  
  Cₛ — Carbon Score: interaction-level human coherence proxy  
  Sₛ — Silicon Score: model-side load and reasoning proxy  
  Hₛ — HER Score: emergent cross-substrate resonance

- **Trajectory analysis**  
  Hₛ(t) curves  
  Drift magnitude estimation  
  Collapse and instability markers

- **AOME (Adaptive Offset Modulation Engine — experimental, advisory-only)**  
  Deterministic mode selection  
  Structured recommendations for behaviour modulation (non-executing)

- **Reproducible demo artifacts**  
  End-to-end example script  
  Small synthetic dialogue dataset  
  Test vectors with expected outputs

---

## What v0.1 Does Not Do

HER2NI v0.1 explicitly does **not**:

- Perform clinical diagnosis or mental-health assessment
- Infer internal mental states of users
- Replace or emulate professional support
- Make claims of accuracy for distress detection
- Require access to proprietary or internal model signals
- Enforce actions, policies, or outcomes

All metrics represent **interaction-level stability and coherence signals**,
not psychological, medical, or legal attributes.

---

## Success Criteria for v0.1

The v0.1 implementation is considered successful if it meets the following:

1. **Protocol fidelity**  
   HER-State packets conform to the v1.0 schema  
   Encode–decode round-trips are lossless within numerical tolerance

2. **Deterministic behaviour**  
   Identical inputs yield identical outputs  
   Canonical test cases pass (stability, drift, contradiction, collapse)

3. **Operational metric baselines**  
   Cₛ, Sₛ, Hₛ computable for multi-turn dialogue  
   Hₛ(t) trajectories respond meaningfully to dialogue changes

4. **Reproducibility**  
   A new user can run the demo in under 10 minutes  
   Outputs match documented examples

5. **Clear ethical boundaries**  
   Documentation consistently frames the system as non-clinical,
   evaluative, and research-oriented

HER2NI is expected to fail in some contexts; identifying those failure modes
is a primary research goal.

---

## Example Usage (Illustrative)

```
# Validate a HER-State packet
her2ni validate examples/dialogue_01.json

# Run the reference demo
her2ni demo examples/dialogue_01.json

# Summarize coherence trajectory
her2ni summarize examples/dialogue_01.json
```

Example output:
```
Mean Hs: 0.84  
Max drift event: turn 7
Collapse risk: none detected  
AOME mode: STABLE_DEEP_REASONING  
```

---

## Ethical & Safety Framing

HER2NI is designed as a **measurement and observability framework**.

- No personally identifiable information (PII) is required or encoded
- Dialogue data should be anonymised at source
- Metrics describe interaction dynamics, not individuals
- Outputs inform AI safety research, evaluation design, and governance studies

HER2NI and its reference implementations do not autonomously intervene in
live systems. All interpretation and action remain human-governed.

Use of HER2NI should comply with applicable research ethics standards and
data-protection requirements.

## Experimental Companion: HER2NI-EXPERIMENTAL v0.1

This repository links to an explicitly non-normative experimental companion:

**HER2NI-EXPERIMENTAL v0.1 — Specification Validation and Falsification Schema**

This document:

- Defines explicit falsification criteria for HER2NI assumptions
- Specifies experimental normative behaviours for testing
- Provides minimal validation and calibration harnesses
- Exists to surface failure modes before any future normative lock-in

## Licensed Systems

A licensed forensic evidence system built on the HER2NI protocol family
is developed and distributed separately.

Research access to the protocol does **not** grant access to licensed systems.
